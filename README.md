## Sithi: Na:kha:
## An ancient and scientific festival.

Spot a house in Kathmandu with a rooftop or underground tank. Easy! Right? Now, spot someone cleaning them. Not so easy task, right? 

For Kathmanduites, either of the two kinds of tanks or both is a prerequisite. But, such tanks mushroomed only a couple of decades ago. If so, what about the time before that? 

People used to go to lo hitis (stone spouts) or wells or use hand pumps to get their water. More interestingly, as a way of respecting and preserving them, the Newa community always had an annual cleaning ritual. Just near the onset of the monsoon comes Sithi Nakha. This festival, also called Kumar Shashthi (dedicated to Lord Kumar, son of Ganga) marks the start of the monsoon and the end of the festival season.

Today is that day. Hence, perhaps, it is now a good occasion to start better taking care of water sources inside your home today.
